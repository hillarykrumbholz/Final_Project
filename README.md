### Segment 1: <br>
<strong> Slected Topic: </strong> Presence of Mental Health Disorders in the Tech Workforce
<strong> Reason for Choosing this Topic: </strong>  A driving interest in mental health. Initially wanted to see if there was a correlation between TBI's and mental health later in life, but had trouble finding a dataset. Also, with many more people working from home and the steady increase of jobs in tech, this general topic seems timely. 
<strong> Data Source: </strong> CSV and JSON file from kaggle. It is a survey dataset from 2016 that has 1443 observations (individuals that participated in the survey) with 63 features (questions that were asked). 
<strong> Questions we Hope to Answer: </strong> 
1. Based off how idividuals answer the survey, are you able to predict whether or not they have a diagnosed mental health disorder?
2. Are there specific aspects of a company that correlate to the presence of mental health disorders?


<strong> Null Hypothesis: </strong> There is no correlation between a mental health disorder diagnosis and working in tech <br>  
<strong> Alternative Hypothesis: </strong> Based off how one responds to questions on a survey, you are able to predict if one has a diagnosed mental health disorder. <br> 
<strong> Datasest: </strong>OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey 2016 <br>
<strong> Label: </strong>Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional? <br>


### Data Cleaning
##### Initial Step
The first step we took in cleaning the data set was to remove any columns with a less than 70% response.
