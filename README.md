# Final_Project

### Null: There is no correlation between a mental health disorder diagnosis and working in tech <br>  
### Hypothesis: Based off how one responds to questions on a survey, you are able to predict if one has a diagnosed mental health disorder. <br> 
### Dataset: OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey 2016 <br>
### Label: Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional? <br>


### Data Cleaning
##### Initial Step
The first step we took in cleaning the data set was to remove any columns with a less than 70% response.
